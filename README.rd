This is my investigation into using the tool calls DreamFactory

Setup:

-    Register account at https://genie.dreamfactory.com/register
-    Ready the connection info of your databse (host, port, username, password).
-    Go to DreamFactory console, go to "Services" tab, click "Create", and select the database type. Then fill in the connection info.
-    Now you can go to API Doc tab to see the automatically generated live swagger documentation, and you can start to experiment with your API there!
